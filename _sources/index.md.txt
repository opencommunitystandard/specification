Open Community - HSDS

<!-- ![Open Referral](assets/OpenReferral_Logo_Green.png) -->

This site contains documentation for OpenCommunity's version of the [Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)](hsds). The HSDS, and related specifications were originally developed by the [Open Referral Initiative](https://www.openreferral.org).

These standards can be used to structure and exchange information about the accessibility of health, human, and social services. Specifically, the HSDS describes data about organizations, the services they provide, the locations at which these services can be accessed, and associated details.
